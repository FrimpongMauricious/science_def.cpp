string mitosis="Mitosis is the division of a parent cell to produce two identical cells such that the resulting cells have the same number of chromosome as the parent cell.";
string meiosis="Meiosis is the process by which one parent cell divides its self to produce four daughter cells of which each cell has half the number of chromosomes as has the parent cell";
string organic_chemistry="Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with study of carbon compounds(examples of carbon compounds include methane, propane etc)";

string threshold_frequency="threshold frequency is the minimum frequency below which no photo-electron can be emitted from the surface of a metal";
string resonance="Resonance is the phenomenon where a periodic body is set into vibration at its own natural frequency as result of impulse it receives from another body vibrating at the same frequency.example is soldiers matching on bridge. ";
